# Reviewer Dashboard with Dummy Data

Here is where you can access the live app on shiny
https://baileybaumann.shinyapps.io/dummydatareviewerpool/

We are using this app as a test case to show
- What data we will need from STC & SQL
- The value in investing in Shiny to create flexible dashboards like this

As this is a public dashboard, there is now real reviewer information. For GDPR and business reasons, we will only want personal and proprietary data on a private dashboard.
